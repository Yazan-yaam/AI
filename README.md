# AI-Powered Health Monitoring System

## Summary
The project aims to develop an AI-powered health monitoring system that utilizes wearable sensors to track vital signs and detect early signs of health issues. The system provides real-time alerts and insights to users and healthcare providers.

## Background
Health monitoring is crucial for early detection and prevention of diseases. Many people do not have access to continuous health monitoring, leading to undiagnosed health issues. This project aims to provide a solution that is accessible and affordable, improving overall health outcomes.

* Problem 1: Lack of continuous health monitoring for many individuals
* Problem 2: Delayed diagnosis of potential health issues
* Problem 3: Limited access to healthcare resources

## How is it used?
The solution involves wearable sensors that collect data on vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This data is analyzed in real-time using AI algorithms to detect anomalies. Users and healthcare providers receive alerts via a mobile app, enabling timely intervention.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data is collected from wearable sensors. The AI algorithms used include machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive analytics.

| Data Source      | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Wearable Sensors | Data on vital signs |
| Health Records   | Historical health data |

## Challenges
* The system does not replace professional medical diagnosis.
* Ensuring data privacy and security is critical.
* The accuracy of the system depends on the quality of the sensors and the data collected.

## What next?
The project can be expanded to include more types of sensors and health metrics. Collaboration with healthcare providers can improve the system's accuracy and reliability. Further development can involve integrating with electronic health records for comprehensive health monitoring.
